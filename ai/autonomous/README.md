# Autonomous System Components

This directory contains the core autonomous operation components that enable self-managing, self-monitoring, and self-improving AI agent systems.

## Components

### Core Engine
- **`engine.py`** - Main autonomous execution engine and decision-making system
- **`loop.py`** - Autonomous operation loop and workflow management

### Safety & Monitoring
- **`safety.py`** - Safety constraints, guardrails, and failure prevention
- **`monitor.py`** - System health monitoring and performance tracking
- **`feedback.py`** - Feedback collection and learning integration

## Features

### Autonomous Engine
- Self-directed task identification and execution
- Intelligent priority management
- Resource allocation and optimization
- Memory-driven decision making

### Safety Systems
- Automated safety constraint validation
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Human override capabilities

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time system health tracking
- Performance metric collection
- Alert generation and escalation
- Resource usage optimization

## Usage

### Starting Autonomous Mode
```python
from ai.autonomous.engine import AutonomousEngine

engine = AutonomousEngine(
    safety_enabled=True,
    max_concurrent_tasks=5,
    learning_mode=True
)

# Start autonomous operation
engine.start()
```

### Monitoring System Health
```python
from ai.autonomous.monitor import SystemMonitor

monitor = SystemMonitor()
health_status = monitor.get_system_health()
print(f"System health: {health_status.overall_status}")
```

### Safety Configuration
```python
from ai.autonomous.safety import SafetyManager

safety = SafetyManager()
safety.add_constraint("no_production_database_changes")
safety.set_risk_threshold(0.7)  # 70% risk threshold
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `AUTONOMOUS_MODE_ENABLED` - Enable autonomous operation (default: false)
- `SAFETY_MODE` - Safety level: strict|moderate|permissive (default: strict)
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` - Maximum parallel tasks (default: 3)
- `MONITORING_INTERVAL` - Health check interval in seconds (default: 60)

## Safety Features

### Constraints
- Production environment protection
- Code change approval requirements
- Resource usage limits
- Time-based operation windows

### Monitoring
- Continuous health checks
- Performance degradation detection
- Error rate tracking
- Resource exhaustion prevention

## Integration

### Memory System
- Learns from successful autonomous operations
- Remembers failure patterns and prevention strategies
- Stores performance optimization insights

### Enhanced Agents
- Coordinates with enhanced agents for task execution
- Delegates specialized tasks to appropriate agents
- Aggregates results and feedback
