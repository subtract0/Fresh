# Workflow Management

This directory contains workflow definition, execution, and management components for orchestrating complex AI agent operations.

## Components

### Core Workflow Engine
- **`engine.py`** - Workflow execution engine and orchestration system
- **`types.py`** - Workflow data types, structures, and definitions

### Workflow Definition
- **`language.py`** - Workflow definition language and parsing
- **`templates.py`** - Reusable workflow templates and patterns

## Features

### Workflow Engine
- Multi-step workflow execution
- Conditional branching and decision points
- Parallel task execution capabilities
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Progress tracking and monitoring

### Workflow Language
- Human-readable workflow definitions
- YAML/JSON configuration support
- Variable interpolation and templating
- Agent assignment and task routing

### Template System
- Pre-built workflow templates for common patterns
- Customizable workflow components
- Template inheritance and composition
- Best practice workflow patterns

## Usage

### Defining a Workflow
```python
from ai.workflows.language import WorkflowDefinition

workflow = WorkflowDefinition.from_yaml("""
name: "Feature Implementation Workflow"
steps:
  - name: "analyze_requirements"
    agent: "EnhancedArchitect"
    inputs: ["feature_description"]
    
  - name: "create_tests"
    agent: "EnhancedQA"
    depends_on: ["analyze_requirements"]
    
  - name: "implement_feature"
    agent: "EnhancedDeveloper" 
    depends_on: ["create_tests"]
    
  - name: "review_code"
    agent: "EnhancedQA"
    depends_on: ["implement_feature"]
""")
```

### Executing a Workflow
```python
from ai.workflows.engine import WorkflowEngine

engine = WorkflowEngine(
    memory_enabled=True,
    parallel_execution=True,
    max_retries=3
)

result = engine.execute_workflow(
    workflow=workflow,
    inputs={"feature_description": "User authentication system"}
)
```

### Using Templates
```python
from ai.workflows.templates import get_template

# Use pre-built template
auth_workflow = get_template("feature_implementation")
auth_workflow.configure(
    feature_type="authentication",
    testing_strategy="integration",
    deployment_target="staging"
)
```

## Workflow Types

### Development Workflows
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixing and resolution
- Code refactoring and optimization
- Test creation and maintenance

### Quality Workflows
- Code review and validation
- Documentation generation
- Performance testing
- Security analysis

### Deployment Workflows
- Build and packaging
- Environment preparation
- Rollout and monitoring
- Rollback and recovery

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_MODE` - sync|async (default: async)
- `MAX_PARALLEL_WORKFLOWS` - Maximum concurrent workflows (default: 5)
- `WORKFLOW_TIMEOUT` - Default workflow timeout in seconds (default: 3600)
- `WORKFLOW_RETRY_COUNT` - Default retry count for failed steps (default: 3)

## Integration

### Memory System
- Learns from successful workflow patterns
- Remembers optimal agent assignments
- Stores workflow performance metrics

### Enhanced Agents
- Seamless integration with all enhanced agents
- Intelligent task routing and load balancing
- Agent capability matching

## Monitoring

Track workflow metrics:
- Execution time and performance
- Success and failure rates
- Agent utilization and efficiency
- Bottleneck identification
