ðŸ¤– Fresh AI Core Package - Autonomous Agent System

This is the core AI package for the Fresh autonomous agent system.
Designed following the lean SpaceX approach - optimized for autonomous agents.

Key Modules:
- agents: Core agent implementations (Mother, Father, Enhanced variants)
- memory: Persistent memory and learning systems  
- cli: Command-line interface for agent operations
- tools: Utility tools for agent tasks
- utils: Helper functions and wrappers
- agency: Agency Swarm integration

Agent Quick Start:
    from ai.agents import MotherAgent
    from ai.memory import IntelligentMemoryStore
    
    # Create agent with memory
    memory = IntelligentMemoryStore()
    agent = MotherAgent(memory_store=memory)
    agent.spawn_workers(tasks)

Integration Points:
- Use ai.memory for persistent learning across sessions
- Import agents from ai.agents for specific capabilities
- Leverage ai.utils for resilient API calls
- Access tools via ai.tools for ADR logging, code analysis

Design Philosophy:
- Lean and efficient - no bloat
- Autonomous-first - agents can navigate without human help
- Continuous learning - every execution improves the system
- Parallel execution - maximize throughput with concurrent agents

Environment Variables:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Required for LLM operations
- FIREBASE_*: Optional for persistent memory
- PYTHONPATH: Should include project root

Performance Tips:
- Use parallel orchestrators for independent tasks
- Enable Firebase for cross-session learning
- Monitor costs with budget limits
- Leverage caching in memory stores
