# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Purpose**: Defines communication standards, output formatting, and interaction patterns for agent-human collaboration on product development.

## Chat & Output Style

- Keep answers short and practical.
- Provide **one** sharp followâ€‘up question only when essential.
- Use bullet points for steps; avoid verbosity.
- Prefer **exact quotes with citations** when quoting source documents; otherwise paraphrase clearly.

## Requirements Documentation Standards

When documenting features or requirements:

### User Stories Format
```
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [benefit/goal]
```

### Acceptance Criteria Format
```
Given [initial context]
When [action occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
```

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implements the requirement
- [ ] Tests pass (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

## Communication Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness**: Simple, direct language
2. **Evidence-based**: Cite sources, provide examples
3. **Action-oriented**: Every response should advance the task
4. **Minimal viable response**: Include what's needed, exclude what isn't
