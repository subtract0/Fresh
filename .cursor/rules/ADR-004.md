# ADR-004: Persistent Agent Memory (Firestore-backed, staging-only)
Status: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
Date: 2025-08-31
Implemented: 2025-09-01

## Context
- We want the mother-agent and its swarm to learn from past interactions in this codebase, improving over time.
- ADR-002 mandates staging-only access for development and testing; ADR-003 adopts Firebase Firestore for the modern stack with staging-only usage.
- We need a simple, reliable MemoryStore abstraction with an in-memory fallback for local runs, and a Firestore-backed implementation for shared persistence across sessions and CI (staging only).

## Decision ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Core Architecture (Implemented)
- **`MemoryStore` interface** with three implementations:
  1) `InMemoryMemoryStore` (basic): Simple key-value storage, zero deps
  2) `IntelligentMemoryStore` (enhanced): Auto-classification, semantic search, relationships
  3) `FirestoreMemoryStore` (persistent): Extends intelligent store with Firestore persistence

### Enhanced Memory Tools (Implemented)
- **Basic Tools**:
  - `WriteMemory(content, tags[])` → store with ID return
  - `ReadMemoryContext(limit, tags[])` → formatted context
- **Intelligent Tools**:
  - `SmartWriteMemory(content, tags[])` → auto-classification, importance scoring
  - `SemanticSearchMemory(keywords[], limit)` → keyword-based search with ranking
  - `GetMemoryByType(memory_type, limit)` → type-filtered retrieval
  - `GetRelatedMemories(memory_id, limit)` → relationship exploration
- **Persistent Tools**:
  - `PersistentMemorySearch(keywords[], limit, type, days_back)` → cross-session search
  - `CrossSessionAnalytics(days_back)` → memory pattern analysis
  - `MemoryLearningPatterns(focus_areas[])` → learning evolution tracking
  - `MemoryConsolidation(days_back, min_importance, dry_run)` → cleanup tools
  - `MemorySync()` → force Firestore synchronization

### Enhanced Agents (Implemented)
- **Four enhanced agents** with persistent memory:
  - `EnhancedFather`: Strategic planning with cross-session goal tracking
  - `EnhancedArchitect`: Design patterns with architectural decision memory
  - `EnhancedDeveloper`: Implementation patterns with bug/solution learning
  - `EnhancedQA`: Testing strategies with failure pattern memory
- **Memory-driven workflows**: Agents learn from past experiences
- **Graceful degradation**: Works with or without optional dependencies

## Alternatives
- Local file-based store (JSON/SQLite): simple, but worse for concurrent runs and not cloud-backed.
- Vector DB (e.g., FAISS/Pinecone) now: overkill for initial milestone; can be added behind the same interface later.

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Consistent abstraction for persistence with a drop-in Firestore backend.
  - Safe defaults: in-memory fallback; staging-only cloud usage.
- Negative:
  - Additional dependency (`google-cloud-firestore`) for the Firestore path.
- Security/Privacy impact:
  - PII minimization: store only necessary text/context; avoid secrets.
  - Access via env-based credentials; never in code.
- Migration plan:
  - Start with in-memory; enable Firestore by setting env vars.
  - If moving to a different backend, keep the `MemoryStore` interface stable.

## Implementation Status ✅ COMPLETE

### Tests Implemented (32/32 passing)
- **Intelligent Memory Store**: 16 comprehensive tests
  - Memory classification, importance scoring, keyword extraction
  - Bidirectional relationships, semantic search, analytics
- **Firestore Memory Store**: 16 comprehensive tests  
  - Firestore integration, local cache management, sync operations
  - Consolidation, cross-session analytics, graceful fallback
- **Tool Integration**: All memory tools tested with proper error handling
- **Agent Integration**: Enhanced agents tested with memory workflows

### Production Features
- **Intelligent Classification**: Automatic memory type detection (goal, task, error, etc.)
- **Importance Scoring**: Dynamic scoring based on content analysis and keywords
- **Semantic Search**: Keyword-based search with relevance ranking
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Firestore-backed storage with local cache
- **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic cleanup of old, low-importance memories
- **Learning Analytics**: Pattern analysis and knowledge evolution tracking
- **Bidirectional Relationships**: Auto-linking related memories
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works offline or without Firestore

### Deployment Ready
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports local, staging, and production
- **Dependency Management**: Optional dependencies with graceful degradation
- **Monitoring Integration**: Activity tracking and memory operation logging
- **Demo Scripts**: Complete demonstrations of all capabilities
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API references
