# Documentation Writing Style Guide

When writing or editing documentation in the `docs/` directory, follow these style guidelines:

## Writing Standards
- **Reading level**: Write at 9th-grade reading level for accessibility
- **No emojis**: Keep documentation professional and emoji-free
- **Conversational tone**: Use "you", "we", "I" to make content personal and engaging
- **Active voice**: Prefer active over passive voice
- **Specific examples**: Include concrete examples and metrics when possible

## Technical Content
- **Actionable insights**: Focus on practical, implementable advice over theory
- **Code examples**: Include working code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
- **Performance metrics**: Include specific numbers and improvements when available
- **Company attribution**: Reference companies and speakers for credibility

## Markdown Formatting
- **Headers**: Use proper hierarchy (H1 for titles, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
- **Bold text**: Use `**bold**` for emphasis and labels
- **Code blocks**: Use triple backticks with language specification
- **Lists**: Use `-` for bullet points with consistent formatting
- **Links**: Use descriptive link text, not "click here"

## Content Organization
- **Clear structure**: Organize content with logical flow and clear headings
- **Key takeaways**: Highlight main insights with `**Key Takeaway:**` format
- **Scannable content**: Use bullet points, short paragraphs, and clear headings
- **Consistent formatting**: Match existing document styles in the same directory

## Technical Accuracy
- **Verify examples**: Ensure all code examples work and are up-to-date
- **Check links**: Verify all internal and external links are functional
- **Consistent terminology**: Use the same terms throughout related documents
- **Proper citations**: Reference sources and speakers appropriately

## Project Setup
- **Dependency installation**: Always use `uv sync --all-extras` to install all dependencies and extras for building and working with documentation.
