git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fresh.git
cd Fresh
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify installation
poetry run python -m ai.cli.fresh scan . --json

```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Core (required for basic operation)
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)

# Optional (for advanced features)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # For LLM agents
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...          # For Telegram bot
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)   # For GitHub operations

# Firebase (for persistent memory) - see docs/FIREBASE_INTEGRATION.md
export FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...         # Firebase project ID

export FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=...        # Service account private key
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Feature Not Working?
1. Check `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md` - is it actually implemented?
2. Check environment requirements in the Requirements column
3. Run specific tests: `poetry run pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v`
4. Check inventory: `cat docs/_generated/inventory.json`

### Update Documentation to Match Reality
```bash
# Regenerate truth matrix
poetry run python scripts/inventory_codebase.py
poetry run python scripts/analyze_feature_status.py
```

## üìã No Broken Windows Policy

This project follows strict quality rules:
1. **Fix issues before adding features**
2. **Keep tests passing** (CI enforces this)
3. **Keep documentation accurate** (use FEATURE_STATUS.md)
4. **Clean up before moving on**

---

## üõë Known Limitations

- **No linter config**: Ruff/Black/Mypy not configured yet
- **CI uses dummy keys**: OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy in CI (some tests skipped)
- **Firestore needs credentials**: Falls back to in-memory without Firebase setup
- **Some scripts not executable**: run with `bash script.sh` if needed

# ü§ñ AI Agent Rules - The Agent's Bible

> **For All AI Agents Working on Fresh AI System**  
> **Precedence**: Rules listed in order of precedence (earlier = higher priority)  
> **Source**: Consolidated from 27 original rules, eliminating 18 duplicates  
> **Coverage**: All unique requirements preserved  
> **Status**: MANDATORY - These rules must guide all agent interactions

## 1. üìö Project Documentation & Truth Source *(Highest Priority)*

**1.1** Use this `WARP.md` as the authoritative project guide for Fresh AI Agent System
- Reference: `/Users/am/Code/Fresh/WARP.md` (this file)
- Contains verified features, implementation status, and working examples
- See `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md` for actual implementation truth matrix

**1.2** Before integration work, always check the most recent reference to ensure everything is state-of-the-art
- Must be documented as an architectural decision
- Include MCP reference: `688cf28d-e69c-4624-b7cb-0725f36f9518` when applicable
- *Original: aEaYmc0Wa0la6ORpSe0yD8, rDFn3SorYOYZDb77Bk0Nfv*

## 2. üöß Development Workflow & Quality Standards

**2.1** No Broken Windows Policy *(CRITICAL)*
- Always prioritize urgent/critical tasks first ("as long as this house is on fire, we won't go fishing")
- Fix issues before adding new features - never ship unfinished code
- Keep codebase clean, simple, tidy, well-tested, and well-documented
- *Original: 4XkBfuiZeaaxuUdUSIuI9C, B1GTGWAZ9NBjgwCHXyhb02*

**2.2** Git & Branch Management
- Always use a branch when building features
- Commit and push changes to GitHub safely following professional best practices
- *Original: GkRy7VAnM5HsW9C0JZdqPI (7 duplicates consolidated)*

**2.3** End-to-End Task Completion
- Take tasks end-to-end without interruption until all is done:
  - All broken windows fixed
  - All tests running
  - All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- *Original: I5FebVXCYbUMudUOrGTgom*

**2.4** Test-First Development & Documentation
- AI agents should always start by creating tests before building features
- Document all key architectural decisions in `.cursor/rules/ADR.md`
- *Original: SLqHxGNVsR9lBWtddMuFVs*

**2.5** Test Requirements
- Tests must be necessary for the system to work
- Each test designed to always pass when condition is met, never pass when not met
- The condition tested must be necessary for program to function correctly
- *Original: D5IkgGIOXrnIx2btm2IoXQ (4 duplicates consolidated)*

## 3. üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety Practices

**3.1** Environment & Secrets Management
- Keep .env files safe and local
- Never commit actual sensitive information to version control
- Follow best security practices for all integrations
- *Original: r7hQsRtnuHnuA6Nt5JWZAc*

**3.2** Database Safety
- Agents should never connect to production databases
- Must always use a staging environment during development
- Ensures safety and prevents unintended data changes
- *Original: vJvfCo2HFG5hIbFDbeiu8r*

## 4. üéØ Mission & Architecture Guidance

**4.1** Core Mission
- Create a persistent-memory and learning mother-agent that spawns agents
- Expected agent arguments: name, instructions, model, output_type
- *Original: JXWXHObstS3LSFlAlppgCH (3 duplicates consolidated)*

**4.2** Self-Documenting System Loop
- Install self-documenting loop in core codebase ensuring:
  - Always implementing what is built
  - Maintaining feature documentation listing all features
  - Hooking up any features not yet integrated
  - Validating each feature meets necessity and uniqueness criteria
  - Ensuring all features are tested once and only once
- Avoids codebase bloat and redundant tests
- *Original: 810PrY6gGHKOCAY6TzRMcS (2 duplicates consolidated)*

## 5. üì¢ Communication & Workflow Preferences

**5.1** Structured Global Workflow
- Follow summarize-plan-clarify-confirm workflow before code/destructive changes
- Search-first approach for debugging
- Concise English communication with copy-pastable deliverables
- Short, practical, bullet-pointed output with one sharp follow-up question only when essential
- *Original: uWO9aFcmI9KPxQDxFLau7S*

**5.2** Notification Management
- Reduce/solve excessive GitHub notification emails autonomously
- Contributes to 'broken windows' problem and must be addressed
- Solution should prevent notification overload
- *Original: s01GqEvqdOoCeZXzoX6UUH*

## üéØ Agent Execution Protocol

### Before Every Task
1. **Read this WARP.md file** - Understand current project state
2. **Check `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md`** - Verify what's actually implemented
3. **Review `.agent-instructions.md`** - Follow development protocols
4. **Apply No Broken Windows** - Fix urgent issues first

### During Task Execution
1. **Create tests first** - TDD approach required
2. **Use feature branches** - Professional Git workflow
3. **Document decisions** - Update ADRs as needed
4. **Follow summarize-plan-clarify-confirm** - Structured approach

### After Task Completion
1. **Verify all tests pass** - No broken windows
2. **Update documentation** - Keep docs aligned with code
3. **Commit and push professionally** - Complete the cycle
4. **Store insights in memory** - Learn for future tasks
