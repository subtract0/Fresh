# Releases

## v0 (baseline)
- Tag: v0
- Commit: 638624ab541d
- Date: 2025-09-02
- Purpose: Establish a clean, stable baseline for three supported modes of operation:
  - Build on itself (extend Fresh incrementally)
  - Scaffold new applications (outside this repo)
  - Assist other repositories (operate as an agent tool against a target repo)
- Notes:
  - Keep changes small, shippable, and verifiable (v0.1, v0.2, â€¦)
  - Avoid broad, multi-feature edits; prefer focused MVPs with tests and docs
