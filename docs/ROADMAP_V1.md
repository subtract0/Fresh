# Fresh v1.0 Implementation Roadmap

> **Purpose**: Transform Fresh from a collection of components into a seamless, value-delivering autonomous development system
> **Timeline**: 4 weeks to v1.0
> **Principle**: No Broken Windows - each phase must be complete and tested before moving on

## 🎯 Vision Statement

Fresh v1.0: **The AI that builds and maintains software autonomously**

A single command spawns intelligent agents that understand your codebase, learn from experience, and autonomously fix issues, add features, and maintain code quality.

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Complete Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Goal**: Make existing components work reliably end-to-end

#### 1.1 FirestoreMemoryStore Completion (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Add docker-compose.yml with Firestore emulator
- [ ] Create setup script for local development
- [ ] Write integration tests for cross-session memory
- [ ] Add memory visualization tool
- [ ] Document setup process

**Tests First**:
```python
def test_memory_persists_across_sessions():
    # Write memory in session 1
    # Retrieve in session 2
    # Verify learning patterns
```

#### 1.2 Mother Agent Wiring (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Complete spawn → execute → PR workflow
- [ ] Add progress tracking
- [ ] Implement agent communication protocol
- [ ] Create agent registry

**Tests First**:
```python
def test_mother_spawns_working_child():
    # Mother spawns child with task
    # Child executes and reports back
    # Verify output and memory update
```

#### 1.3 Integration Testing Framework (Days 5-7)
- [ ] Create test fixtures for common scenarios
- [ ] Add end-to-end test suite
- [ ] Set up test databases/repos
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks

---

### Phase 2: The Magic Command (Week 2)
**Goal**: One command that delivers immediate value

#### 2.1 Command Design (Day 1)
```bash
fresh fix "the login is broken"
fresh add "OAuth with Google" 
fresh refactor "split user service"
fresh test "add coverage for auth"
```

#### 2.2 Implementation (Days 2-4)
- [ ] Create unified CLI entry point
- [ ] Implement task understanding
- [ ] Wire scan → analyze → plan → execute
- [ ] Add Rich progress UI

**Tests First**:
```python
def test_magic_command_fixes_real_issue():
    # Create repo with known bug
    # Run: fresh fix "type error in auth"
    # Verify fix is correct
    # Verify tests still pass
```

#### 2.3 Dogfooding (Days 5-7)
- [ ] Use Fresh to fix Fresh issues
- [ ] Document what works/doesn't
- [ ] Iterate based on experience
- [ ] Create success metrics

---

### Phase 3: Real-World Templates (Week 3)
**Goal**: Production-ready scaffolds that provide instant value

#### 3.1 FastAPI Template (Days 1-2)
```bash
fresh scaffold api --name MyAPI --auth jwt --db postgres
```
- [ ] FastAPI with async support
- [ ] JWT authentication
- [ ] PostgreSQL with migrations
- [ ] Docker setup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring setup

#### 3.2 Next.js Template (Days 3-4)
```bash
fresh scaffold frontend --name MyApp --auth clerk --style tailwind
```
- [ ] Next.js 14 with App Router
- [ ] Clerk authentication
- [ ] Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Testing setup
- [ ] Vercel deployment

#### 3.3 CLI Tool Template (Days 5-6)
```bash
fresh scaffold cli --name mytool --lang python
```
- [ ] Click/Typer setup
- [ ] Testing framework
- [ ] Distribution setup
- [ ] Documentation template

#### 3.4 Template Registry (Day 7)
- [ ] Create template discovery system
- [ ] Add template validation
- [ ] Enable custom templates

---

### Phase 4: Learning Loop & Polish (Week 4)
**Goal**: Make agents truly learn and improve

#### 4.1 Learning System (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Implement outcome tracking
- [ ] Pattern analysis engine
- [ ] Strategy updates based on outcomes
- [ ] Memory consolidation

**Tests First**:
```python
def test_agent_learns_from_failure():
    # Agent attempts task and fails
    # Records failure pattern
    # Attempts similar task with new approach
    # Verify improvement
```

#### 4.2 Telemetry & Analytics (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Add anonymous usage tracking
- [ ] Success/failure metrics
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] User feedback collection

#### 4.3 Documentation & Recipes (Days 6-7)
- [ ] Create 10 copy-paste recipes
- [ ] Video walkthroughs
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Contributing guide

## 🛠️ Implementation Principles

1. **TDD First**: Write tests before implementation
2. **No Broken Windows**: Fix issues before adding features
3. **Document as You Go**: Update docs with each feature
4. **Dogfood Everything**: Use Fresh to build Fresh
5. **User Value Focus**: Every feature must provide clear value

---

## 📝 Daily Checklist

- [ ] Run `fresh scan .` to check for issues
- [ ] Fix any broken tests before new work
- [ ] Update FEATURE_STATUS.md if adding features
- [ ] Commit with ADR reference
- [ ] Use Fresh to implement at least one task

---

## 🎬 Getting Started

```bash
# Day 1: Set up development environment
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Run current tests to ensure clean slate
poetry run pytest

# Start with first task
poetry run python -m ai.cli.fresh spawn "Implement FirestoreMemoryStore Docker setup"
```
