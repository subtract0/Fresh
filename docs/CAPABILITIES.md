# Capabilities vs Claims Matrix

This document maps documented claims to concrete implementation evidence in the codebase. Each capability lists the code location, dependencies, and verification notes.

Status legend: ✅ Implemented • ⚠️ Requires setup • ⏳ Planned/Partial

---

## Memory System

- IntelligentMemoryStore — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/memory/intelligent_store.py
  - Features: auto-classification, keyword extraction, importance scoring, relationship detection, analytics
  - Verified by: tests/test_intelligent_memory.py; demo scripts (scripts/demo-persistent-memory.py)

- InMemoryMemoryStore — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/memory/store.py (class InMemoryMemoryStore)
  - Features: simple in-memory write/query for dev/testing
  - Verified by: used implicitly via get_store(); fallback behavior in tools

- FirestoreMemoryStore — ⚠️ Implemented (requires environment)
  - Code: ai/memory/firestore_store.py
  - Dependencies: google-cloud-firestore; FIREBASE_* environment variables
  - Verified by: tests/test_firestore_memory.py (requires configured env to run fully)

---

## Memory Tools

- Enhanced Memory Tools — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/tools/enhanced_memory_tools.py (SmartWriteMemory, SemanticSearchMemory, GetMemoryByType, GetRelatedMemories)
  - Behavior: graceful fallback when agency_swarm/pydantic aren’t available
  - Verified by: import-level sanity checks; used in agents and demos

- Persistent Memory Tools — ⚠️ Implemented (persistent functions require Firestore)
  - Code: ai/tools/persistent_memory_tools.py (PersistentMemorySearch, CrossSessionAnalytics, MemoryLearningPatterns, MemoryConsolidation)
  - Notes: runs in local mode without Firestore for partial functionality

---

## Enhanced Agents

- Enhanced Agents (Father, Architect, Developer, QA) — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/agents/enhanced_agents.py
  - Notes: graceful fallback if agency_swarm not installed (DummyTool pattern)
  - Verified by: scripts/demo-agent-activity.py, import tests; behavior depends on external agent runtime

- DocumentationAgent — ✅ Implemented (new)
  - Code: ai/agents/DocumentationAgent.py
  - Purpose: run documentation alignment checks and store learnings
  - Tools: DocsAlignmentCheck, SmartWriteMemory

---

## Orchestration & Workflows

- Workflow Engine (AAWOS) — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/workflows/engine.py, ai/workflows/types.py, ai/workflows/language.py, ai/workflows/templates.py
  - Verified by: present modules and integration points; example usage in guides

- System Coordinator & Launcher — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/system/coordinator.py, ai/system/memory_integration.py, launch_agent_system.py, launch_enhanced_agent_system.py

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

- Adaptive Monitoring — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/monitor/activity.py, ai/execution/monitor.py, ai/coordination/status.py

- Performance Analytics — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/analytics/performance.py

---

## Integrations

- GitHub Integration — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/integration/github.py

- MCP Integration — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/integration/mcp_discovery.py, ai/tools/enhanced_mcp.py, ai/tools/mcp_client.py

- Telegram Interface — ✅ Implemented
  - Code: ai/interface/telegram_bot.py; Docs: docs/TELEGRAM_BOT.md

---

## Testing & Validation

- Pytest Suite — ✅ Present (requires poetry environment)
  - Config: pyproject.toml (pytest configured)
  - Tests: tests/test_intelligent_memory.py, tests/test_firestore_memory.py, other tests present
  - Note: some tests require optional dependencies or real credentials; CI skips or uses fallbacks

---

## Documentation System

- Core Docs — ✅ Implemented and cross-referenced
  - Files: docs/MEMORY_SYSTEM.md, docs/ENHANCED_AGENTS.md, docs/API_REFERENCE.md, docs/AGENT_DEVELOPMENT.md, docs/DEPLOYMENT.md, docs/INDEX.md

- Warp Guide — ✅ Implemented (updated)
  - docs/WARP.md with quick commands; ./.warp init for shell convenience

- Guardrails — ✅ Implemented (new)
  - Scripts: scripts/check_docs_alignment.py
  - CI: .github/workflows/docs-alignment.yml

---

## Known Conditions and Requirements

- Firestore features require:
  - google-cloud-firestore installed (poetry handles dependency)
  - FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL, FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY set

- Agency runtime features (multi-agent orchestration) require:
  - agency-swarm installed (poetry dependency present)
  - OPENAI_API_KEY or equivalent LLM configuration if using real models

- Demos and tests:
  - Use Poetry environment: `poetry install --no-root` then `poetry run pytest`
  - For quick local validation of memory stores, see scripts/demo-persistent-memory.py

---

## Summary

The codebase substantively implements the documented features. Claims around persistent memory, enhanced agents, tools, orchestration, and monitoring are backed by concrete code. Some advanced capabilities depend on optional external services or credentials and gracefully degrade when unavailable. Guardrails have been added to keep documentation aligned with implementation over time.
