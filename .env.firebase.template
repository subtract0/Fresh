# Firebase Configuration Template for Fresh AI Persistent Memory
# Copy this to .env.firebase and fill in your actual values

# === Firebase Configuration ===
# Get these values from your Firebase Project Settings > Service Accounts

# Your Firebase Project ID (found in project settings)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Service account email (from downloaded JSON credentials)
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Private key from service account (include the full key with BEGIN/END markers)
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
[Your Private Key Content Here]
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"

# === Alternative Approach ===
# Instead of environment variables, you can use a credentials file:
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/firebase-service-account.json

# === Optional Firebase Settings ===
# Firestore emulator for local development (uncomment to use)
# FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080

# === Usage ===
# After setting up credentials, load them with:
#   source .env.firebase
# 
# Then use Firebase persistent memory with:
#   poetry run python -m ai.cli.fresh --use-firestore spawn "your task"
#   poetry run python -m ai.cli.fresh orchestrate "complex research task"

# === Security Notes ===
# - Never commit .env.firebase to version control
# - Keep your private key secure and rotate regularly
# - Restrict Firebase service account permissions to minimum required
# - Consider using Google Application Default Credentials in production
